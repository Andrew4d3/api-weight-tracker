Simple API for Ng-weight-tracker

## Description

This is a Dumb API created to be used by the Angular weight tracker sample project I created [here](https://github.com/Andrew4d3/ng-weight-tracker). There are no validations and it's using a Fake JSON database.

## Instructions

- Run `npm install` to install dependecies (using node 10.15.1)
- Run `npm start`.
- The api should start on port 3000
